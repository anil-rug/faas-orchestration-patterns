## Patterns

### **Process Manager**

![Design Decision - Process Manager](images/Design_decisions_process_manager.png)

**Problem**: How does the serverless workflow determine the path in which the message needs to flow if it consists of multiple functions and conditions?

**Decision**: The _Process Manager_ acts as a central processing component for the system. As workflows are influenced by each step's output message, execution states need to be maintained, and based on the result; the succeeding component is invoked.

### **Event and Document Message**

**Problem**: How can the serverless workflow and its involved functions be executed/triggered?

**Decision**: External services or clients can invoke the serverless data processing workflow by an _Event Message_. Furthermore, _Event Messages_ can be used to invoke other workflows or services. As functions are considered a black box, the _Document Message_ containing the data structure message is the most optimum choice when communicating between internal states/functions.
